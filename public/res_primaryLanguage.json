After graduating from highschool in 2018 I jumped directly into an accelerated bootcamp in my area. I earned a graduate degree which I leveraged to land an internship, and sell several freelance projects. My biggest passion is environmentalism, which I hope to positivly impact some day. I have expirience in construction managment, customer service, social media marketing, and social media management. Thank you ðŸ’œ",
