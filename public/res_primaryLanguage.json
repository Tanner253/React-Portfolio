After graduating from highschool in 2018 I jumped directly into an accelerated bootcamp in my area. I earned a graduate degree which I leveraged to land an internship, and sell several freelance projects. My biggest passion is environmentalism, which I hope to positivly impact some day. I have expirience in construction managment, customer service, social media marketing, and social media management. Thank you 💜",

Evaluate your progress by scoring your technical and professional proficiencies and track your improvement over time. Based on Medium’s open source Snowflake Project, this application represents the interdisciplinary efforts of an amazing group of twenty C# and JavaScript developers over a 4 day time period. The current application uses a C# backend to provide user authorization and database management for a JavaScript React/Gatsby front end utilizing Apollo/GraphQL in order to setup an initial application based on client requirements that can be built upon by future developers. To this end, we have worked hard to create an initial roadmap for the success of those that come after us.",

There will be more information found on the homepage like information about business opportunities, Resume information, Affiliation information, and contact information.After the user gets to know the social media influencer and trust/some sort of consumer relationship is formed, push users to browse products the social media influencer is sponsored with, and products the influencer endorses publicly. The user will be able to read about the product in a separate catalog from the store page, and if they are interested in buying the product with the PROMO-CODE to save money/support the influencer then there will be a BUY ME button that links the user to the item and checkout page directly (Hopefully provided by the companies to the influencer when they are sponsored) where sales can be made to bring in money for the social media influencer. The website will redirect traffic while informing them of products and serving them advertisements.",
